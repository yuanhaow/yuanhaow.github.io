I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology
Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory ([MIT CSAIL](https://www.csail.mit.edu/)) working with Professor [Julian Shun](https://people.csail.mit.edu/jshun/).

I recieved my Ph.D. from Carnegie Mellon University, where I was advised by Professor [Guy Blelloch](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/). 

<!-- My research interests are in designing theoretically and practically efficient algorithms for modern computer systems.
My current research has focused on developing high-performance concurrent algorithms as well as libraries and abstractions that simplify concurrent programming. -->

My research interests are in developing high-performance concurrent algorithms for modern computer systems.
My research has focused on designing general, easy-to-use, and efficient techniques for concurrent programming.
